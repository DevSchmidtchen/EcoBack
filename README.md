# HackHPI - EcoBack

EcoBack is a B2B app which helps businesses to sustain their CO2 Footprint. Customers can check-in their receipt and gain points if they buy ecofriendly products.

Rewards for buying a lot of such products will be handed out in form of coupons. Those coupons are limited to e.g. a specific supermarket and their ecofriendly products. Therefore the customers will buy sustainable products again at this supermarket.
